The Company's total PCO also includes the Disaster Recovery Plan prepared to deal with events that entail the unavailability of the Information System.The main internal reference legislation is represented by the Organizational procedure for the insurance continuity of the service, issued in December 2016. This procedure, starting from the identification of the critical business activities, has the objective to determine for each of them organizational controls and business continuity measures commensurate with risk levels. Through the aforementioned process, the Company therefore proposes to limit the probability and impact of a serious interruption of operations and to ensure continuity of service.

For the operational management of the PCO and its updates, the Manager of the Operational Continuity Plan makes use of a dedicated structure (O.U. Business Continuity).
